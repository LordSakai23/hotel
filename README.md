Target Users

Understanding the application's end users is crucial for tailoring feedback, usability improvements, and technical refinement. The target users are grouped into two broad categories: technical and non-technical, to ensure well-rounded feedback that covers both functionality and user experience.

Technical Users

These individuals have a programming background or relevant technical experience, which qualifies them to provide insight on code quality, structure, logic, and integration mechanisms. They include:

1. Friends with programming experience: Peers who can offer casual but insightful reviews based on their familiarity with best coding practices.
2. Co-workers from work experience placements: Professionals who have worked in real-world environments and understand production-grade code, database connectivity, and scalable architecture.
3. Tutors or lecturers from college: Academics or instructors who are familiar with theoretical foundations and can provide structured critiques or advice on improving design, structure, and maintainability.

Non-Technical Users

These individuals represent the typical end-user who may use the application but lacks a technical background. Their feedback is critical for refining the user experience, interface design, and accessibility. They include:

1. Friends without a technical background: Everyday users who can test the app’s intuitiveness, navigability, and visual appeal.
2. Family members: A diverse group with various levels of digital literacy who can highlight ease-of-use issues.
3. Colleagues in non-technical roles: Office workers or users who can assess how practical the application is for people who rely on software but don’t build it.

Feedback Gathering Methods
A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to gather comprehensive feedback. The two main methods selected are Focus Groups and Surveys.

1. Focus Groups
Focus groups are small, moderated discussions involving selected users. These sessions are designed to provide qualitative, in-depth feedback through open conversation and observation.

Technical Focus Group

This group will consist of technically skilled individuals with hands-on experience in programming languages like C# and SQL databases. The primary goal is to analyse the core functionality of the application from a software development perspective. Topics to cover include:

1. Reviewing the structure, logic, and efficiency of the code
2. Identifying bugs, inconsistencies, or inefficiencies
3. Recommending improvements for database interactions, class usage, or code modularity
4. Discussing whether the system design supports scalability and maintainability

Non-Technical Focus Group

This group is composed of users without a development background who will interact with the application as end users. This discussion will focus on:

1. Evaluating the visual design, such as the colour scheme and layout
2. Testing navigational flow to assess how easy it is to move between sections
3. Highlighting elements that might be confusing or overwhelming
4. Suggesting improvements to enhance intuitiveness and user satisfaction

2. Surveys
Surveys will be used to collect structured, measurable feedback from a broader group of users. They provide data that can be quantified to track trends and assess the effectiveness of different features. Surveys will be customized to gather insights based on the technical level of the respondent.

Technical survey responses will help evaluate backend efficiency, programming practices, and code structure.
Non-technical survey responses will gauge user satisfaction, visual appeal, accessibility, and engagement.

Surveys will be conducted using online tools and distributed across different platforms such as email, social media, and internal channels.

Expected Feedback
Anticipating the types of feedback in advance helps prepare for actionable analysis. Feedback will fall into both positive and negative categories.

Negative Feedback

1. Comments about poorly structured or unorganized code
2. Feedback highlighting a lack of proper code commenting and documentation
3. Issues related to performance, bugs, or difficulties with database connectivity
4. Complexity in interface design that might confuse non-technical users

Positive Feedback

1. Praise for a clean, visually appealing, and coherent user interface
2. Appreciation of ease of use, simple navigation, and clear functionality
3. Encouragement related to the innovative nature of the project or its usefulness
4. Positive recognition of the environmental theme and purpose of the application

This feedback will be compiled, analysed, and used to inform further iterations and improvements of the application.

Focus Group Questions
Two sets of questions will be presented to the respective groups during focus group sessions. These will guide the discussion and ensure that all relevant areas are covered.

Technical Questions

1. Is the code well-commented and easy to follow?
2. Are the variable names descriptive and appropriate?
3. What’s the best approach to linking this code to the database?
4. Are the carbon footprint calculations accurate and efficient?

These questions aim to probe deeper into the **software engineering quality** of the application—maintainability, logic, performance, and database integrity.

Non-Technical Questions

1. Is the colour scheme visually appealing and appropriate?
2. Does the user interface feel intuitive and easy to use?
3. Is it easy to navigate through the application?
4. Does the overall application look too complex for everyday users?

These questions help assess the usability and visual design of the app, ensuring it aligns with the expectations of general users.

Survey Questions
The survey is divided into technical and non-technical sections. It includes both closed ended (e.g., rating scales) and open-ended questions for richer feedback.

Technical Survey Questions

1. Do you think the application would benefit from using classes?
2. How would you rate the tidiness of the code?
3. Does the annotation of the application make the code more understandable?
4. Have you worked on an application/project like this?
5. What security measures would you recommend for safeguarding the user’s data?
6. If yes, do you have any feature recommendations?

These questions target those with software development experience. They explore areas such as **object-oriented design**, **code readability**, and **data security**.

Non-Technical Survey Questions
1. What age range are you?
2. Does the green colour scheme reflect energy-saving themes to you?
3. How would you rate the UI (1-5)?
4. Have you ever checked your carbon footprint?
5. Do you have any energy-saving devices at home?
6. Is the navigation within the app clear and simple?
7. Is the carbon footprint calculator easy to use?
8. Are the input fields in the calculator clear and understandable?
9. Does the app feel too complex for its intended use?
10. Do you have any concerns/complaints about the application?

These questions evaluate user perception, environmental awareness, and engagement, providing valuable insight into how well the application communicates its purpose and serves its audience.
